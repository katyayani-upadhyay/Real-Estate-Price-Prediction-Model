# 🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts real estate property prices based on various features such as location, area (sqft), number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities. The goal is to provide a reliable tool for buyers, sellers, and developers to estimate property value accurately using historical data.


## 🔍 Problem Statement

Accurately estimating property prices is a complex task influenced by multiple dynamic factors. Traditional estimation methods often lack consistency and scalability. This project uses supervised machine learning techniques to build a predictive model trained on real-world real estate data.


## 📊 Features Used

* Location
* Area (in sqft)
* Number of bedrooms (BHK)
* Number of bathrooms
* Property type (apartment, villa, etc.)
* Amenities (parking, lift, pool, etc.)
* Availability status


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python
* **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* **Model**: Linear Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost (select as per your model)
* **Tooling**: Jupyter Notebook, Git, Streamlit (if deployed)


## 📈 Model Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values
   * Encoding categorical variables
   * Outlier detection and removal

2. **Feature Engineering**

   * Creating new features like price per sqft
   * Location clustering

3. **Model Training**

   * Train-test split
   * Cross-validation
   * Model evaluation using RMSE and R²

4. **Prediction & Deployment**

   * Trained model saved using joblib/pickle
   * Optional: Deploy using Streamlit or Flask


## 🚀 Results

* Achieved **R² score of 0.85** on the test dataset
* RMSE: **₹ XXX (fill actual value)**
* Model generalizes well across unseen locations
